      <h1>We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries divided between our headquarters in Berlin and our
        offices in Los Angeles and Tokyo.</h1>
      <p>Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use Live and Push every day. We come from a
        wide range of cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught, and most of us
        are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared belief that each of us has the skills and knowledge to
        contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of music culture.</p>

      <h1>We believe it takes focus to create truly outstanding instruments. We only work on a few products and we
        strive to make them great.</h1>
      <p>Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our people what they need to work their magic
        and grow. We’ve learned that achieving the best results comes from building teams that are richly diverse, and
        thus able to explore problems from a wider set of perspectives. We don’t always agree with each other, but
        opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.</p>

      <p> Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively supported in acquiring new knowledge and
        skills, and coached on applying these in their daily work. In addition, staff-organized development and music
        salons are a chance to discuss new technologies, production techniques and best practices.</p>

        will do everything we can to make your transition as easy as possible.</h1>

      <p>If you're joining us in Berlin, we'll help with relocation and paperwork. We’ll even provide you with free
        German or English lessons. Plus, working in Germany means you can expect comprehensive health insurance for you
        and your family, as well as generous maternity and paternity leave. Office hours are flexible, but it’s not all
        work; we have several company and team outings throughout the year as well as a variety of fun, informal
        small-group activities.
